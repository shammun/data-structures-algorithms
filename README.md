# 🚀 Getting Started

The repository contains Python implementation of different data structures and algorithms problems' solutions. This is based on Coursera's specialization titled [**Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms). The code in this repository is organized into various courses and modules. Each course or module contains a set of solutions for different algorithms and data structures.

## 📚 Specialization Overview

The **Data Structures and Algorithms** specialization includes the following courses:
1. **Algorithmic Toolbox**  
   Covers basic algorithmic techniques like greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming.
   
2. **Data Structures**  
   Focuses on the implementation and application of various data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, trees, and heaps.
   
3. **Algorithms on Graphs**  
   Explores graph traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS, shortest paths, and minimum spanning trees.

4. **Algorithms on Strings**  
   Delves into string algorithms including suffix arrays, tries, and pattern matching.

5. **Advanced Algorithms and Complexity**  
   Discusses advanced topics such as NP-complete problems, approximation algorithms, and optimization techniques.

6. **Genome Assembly Programming Challenge**  
   An applied project focusing on reconstructing a genome from DNA fragments.
